            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am an Electrical Engineering student from New Port Richey, Florida. I am currently studying at Florida Polytechnic in Lakeland, Florida. Ever since I got into computers as a child, I have been interested and passionate in everything about electronics. I especially enjoy working with computers. Outside of electrical engineering, I am interested in coding, 3D printing and videogames. More specifically, I am experienced in programming languages like Python, C and C++ and through this knowledge, I am used to all major operating systems. I also have experience and certifications in various CAD and EDA programs. I am also able to use office software effectively.</p> 

                <p>I value getting things done on time, and done correctly.  I am a quick learner who enjoys solving problems and can be flexible. Through the numerous team projects I have been involved in, I have learned to be a team player and can be a useful asset in a team.</p>

        <h3>Career Summary and Goals</h3>
        <p>Throughout my life, I have always been involved in engineering work. I was part of my high schoolâ€™s robotics team, where I developed software and designed parts in CAD.  I also worked with a team to develop a device for cars that detected lights and sirens from emergency vehicles to make them more noticeable in vehicles with poor visibility and large amounts of sound deadening. I am currently studying Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Advanced Topics at Florida Polytechnic University with expectations to graduate in May 2027. Through Florida Poly, I have attended two Hackathon-style events in which I worked on teams to construct various devices, such as a robotic arm and an automatic Etch-A-Sketch. I have been certified in the Autodesk Inventor CAD software, have experience in various programming languages, like C/C++, and Python, and am currently learning Solidworks in the hopes of getting certified. I also have experience with the KiCad EDA suite, and experience with popular micro-controller development boards and single board computers, such as Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi. I am a go-getter who takes pride in my work and can effectively manage my time, and can get work done on time.</p>

        <p>I am seeking an internship in Electrical Engineering in the hopes that I can gain further experience in the field. I also hope to use the experience from these internships to obtain connections within the industry and make it into an entry-level position to start my career. </p>
