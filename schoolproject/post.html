<!-- Text here -->
<p>Recently, I graduated college, and made drastic changes to my lifestyle and have decided to go and live by myself. My family were never supportive of my individual dreams as a child, so this can be described as a much needed break. So I started tramping (or hitchhiking, for those out of the loop). My travels have taken me across the American Southwest (and maybe Mexico, oops), with both sucesses and failures. So here are my tips for surviving out there.</p>
<h3>1.) Plan where you want to go and what you will do when you get there</h3>
<p>The idea of tramping is to go places, so it would be sensible you have an end goal. Granted, the people who will likely pick you up along the way will probably take you somewhere farther away from where you want to go, but remember, it's an "any help is good help" system.</p>
<p>More importantly, you may find it good to pack items that will help you. If you know that where you're going is often cold, pack stuff for the occasion.</p>
<h3>2.) If you have documentation, have it availiable</h3>
<p>In my most recent trip, I ended up in Mexico, thanks to the Colorado river going through the border. When it came time to re-enter the US, i had a hard time getting in, because I had no passport. Save some time and make sure you have something along those lines.</p>
<h3>3.) Have small amounts of money.</h3>
<p>Because tramping involves people driving you places out of the kindness of their hearts, plaease make sure to have gas money to give them for what they did. Furthermore, you never know what you may need to get while ou there.</p>
<h3>4.) Be ready to take longer hikes, and stand for long periods of time</h3>
<p>Most people will likely pass you by, so while waiting for you next car, start walking towards where you want to go. It took me a while before I first got picked up.</p>
<h3>5.) Avoid train-hopping in wagons not used for coal or grain</h3>
<p>Wagons not used for coal and grain typically have doors on them, even though it's a blessing for convenience its a curse for getting caught. Occasionally, the train will stop and the conductor will bring out a dog to sniff you out, and the punishments the give are painful, and in some cases, deadly. I've nearly been killed by a punishment from a conductor. Other types of train cars are better, because the only way in is through the top. This should reduce your likelihood of getting caught.</p>
<h3>6.) Expect the unexpected</h3>
<p>You never know what you are going to get! Some days nobody will be wanting to pick you up, and some you will get picked up instantly.</p>\
<p>In all seriousness, though, sometimes things get really bad, such as when it starts raining and begins to flood. Sometimes some of the most unsavory people will pick you up and take you to their creepy dungeon/lair with no chance of escape. You need to at least put some thought in what could happen. This could save you later on in your journeys.</p>
<h3>7.) Be human about things</h3>
<p>My final tip for this article is to simply be yourself. On many osccasions, you will make lots of friends, aquaintances, and partners along the way. I got my current full time job just by doing this, and it opened me up for more knowledge, advice and help for the next leg of my journey.</p> 
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Thus concludes my tips for staying safe in the wild. These tips worked for me and are likely going to be good for my next trip to Alaska. Anyways, thank you for taking a look at these tips, and stay safe.</p>
